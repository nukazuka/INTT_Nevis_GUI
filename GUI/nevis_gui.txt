DOCUMENTATION FOR THE GUI
=========================

Basic design philosophy:
------------------------

There are two sections: the modules and the global config/ops.  The
modules are represented by a Notebook model on the left, with one tab
per module.  Each module contains in it a list of chip configurations
for ids 0 to 31, and one such list for each side of the module (sides
are numbered 0 and 1).

A chip's configuration consists of the 18 registers (though registers
1 and 18 don't technically have a "value"), its chip ID, and an enable
mask of size 128.

To display or modify the values for the configuration, the user
selects the desired side from the pull-down menu and enters the
desired chip id in the entry field.  Changes to the register values
are automatically stored in the internal configuration for that chip
id (and module and side).  In order to send the value to the chip, the
user presses the "write" button (or in the case of the enable mask,
the "Send" button).

Finally, the panel for each module includes a chip enable sub-panel.
Next to each chip id, the user can turn on/off the chip id for each
side.

The right side of the GUI contains global configurations and
operations panels.  This includes Reset, Init, the daq and a module
enable panel (among other things).  The module enable panel determines
which modules and sides within the module are turned on.
